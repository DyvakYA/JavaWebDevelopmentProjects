Anyone who reads Old and Middle English literary
texts will be familiar with the mid-brown volumes
of the EETS, with the symbol of Alfred's jewel
embossed on the front cover.
Most of the works attributed
to King Alfred or to Aelfric,
along with some of those by

bishop Wulfstan and much anonymous main prose and verse from the
pre-Conquest period, are to be found within the Society's three
series; all of the surviving medieval drama, most of the Middle
English romances, much religious static and secular prose and verse including
the English works of John Gower, Thomas Hoccleve and
most of Caxton's prints all find their place in the publications.
Without EETS editions, public, study of medieval English
texts would hardly be possible.
